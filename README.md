# Setup
Must have a free github account and clicking the deploy button below should get you a free vercel account as well.

# Step 1
Click the Deploy Button Below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexanderthebadatcoding%2Fimage-outage)

# Step 2

Give your repository a name and click create.

# Step 3

Once the project has been created open the github link in the project dashboard. Click the main button.

# Step 4

Replace the images in the Public Folder. Make sure they are 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, 4.png. Also works best with 1200 X 600 px images.

# Step 5 Optional
Rename the first Frame by editing the index.tsx file in the api folder:
```const frameTitle = "Image Outage 2024";```

just change the text in the quoation marks. ie:

```const frameTitle = "Frames are Fun!";```

# Step 6
Vercel should auto update, and create your Picture frame. It will create a link and to share just copy the link with the full /api so for example "https://image-outage.vercel.app/api" If you want to test it go to https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames
